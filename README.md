# Spatio-Temporal Downscaling of Climate Data using Convolutional and Error-Predicting Neural Networks 


This folder contains a tensorflow implementation for the DCN and RPN architectures of the paper:
  
  * Agon Serifi, Tobias GÃ¼nther, Nikolina Ban <br/>
  [Spatio-Temporal Downscaling of Climate Data using Convolutional and Error-Predicting Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2021.656479)
  
The file model.py contains functions to construct the proposed architectures. <br/>
Use 'get_model(residual = False)' for the DCN and 'get_model(residual = True)' for the RPN architecture.
